# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
To better understand trends, an analysis was performed on various metrics of data from the crowfunding platform Kickstarter. The aim of this analysis was to highlight patterns of successful Kickstarter campaigns in order to better advise a potential playwright in organizing a successful fundraising campaign. The various metrics analyzed include the following:

-Type of campaign

-Location

-Launch date

-Length of campaign

By utilizing Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, the data was able to be transformed further to highlight tendencies. One important aspect of successful capaigns appeared to be the launch date of the campagin. As indicated in the figure below, the largest number of successfulc campaigns were launched in May, June, and July.

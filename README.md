# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
To better understand trends, an analysis was performed on various metrics of data from the crowfunding platform Kickstarter. The aim of this analysis was to highlight patterns of successful Kickstarter campaigns in order to better advise a potential playwright in organizing a successful fundraising campaign. The various metrics analyzed include the following:

-Type of campaign

-Location

-Launch date

-Length of campaign

-Funding goal

-Amount pledged by backers

By utilizing Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, the data was able to be transformed further to highlight tendencies. One important aspect of successful capaigns appeared to be the launch date of the campagin in relation to the type of campaign. The graph below shows the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns for all theater campaigns. As indicated in the figure below, the largest number of successfulc theater campaigns were launched in May, June, and July. Additionally, trends indicate that the later in the year the campaign is launched, the less successful it might be.

As the hopeful playwrite is aiming to produce a play in the United States, a look into successful and failed US Kickstarters helped narrow down the data. Furthermore, narrowing the data set down to include only information from plays helps to relate the data set to the playwrite's specific goal. The box and whisker plot below shows the average, median, upper quartile, and lower quartile of the successful and failed play Kickstarter campaigns in the United States.

This graph indicates that successful campaigns had a both a lower mean and median goal then their failed counterparts. Conversely, the amounts pledged for successful Kickstarters were singificantly higher that the pledged amounts for failed Kickstarters. 

Combining this information together, some recommendations for the playwrite can be surmized. To begin with, the playwirte should attempt to launch her campiagn somewhere from May to July if possible, as theater Kickstarters have the highest number of successful campaigns during that time. While the playwrite orginally wanted to rasie $10,000 for her play, the anaylsis of goal and pledged amounts for plays in the United States indicates that she might want to pick a lower goal, as the mean goal for failed campaigns is $10,554 and the mean goal for successful campaigns is $5,049. Lastly, if the playwrite is able to receive support from backers who can contribute larger donations, she may be more successful than if she were to depend on smaller contreibutions from a larger number of backers.
